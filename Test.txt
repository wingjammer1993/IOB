1	Here
2	,
3	we
4	show
5	that

1	Unique
2	to
3	this

5	,
6	the

8	of

10	is
11	negatively
12	modulated
13	by
14	an

1	Here
2	we
3	show
4	that

1	BACKGROUND
2	:
3	The
4	aim
5	of
6	this
7	study
8	was
9	to
10	determine
11	the
12	response
13	rates
14	and
15	toxicity
16	of
17	two
18	regimens
19	containing
20	granulocyte
21	-
22	macrophage
23	-
24	colony
25	stimulating
26	factor
27	(
28	GM
29	-
30	CSF
31	)
32	in
33	combination
34	with
35	interleukin
36	-
37	2
38	(
39	IL
40	-
41	2
42	)
43	in
44	the
45	treatment
46	of
47	patients
48	with
49	metastatic
50	renal
51	cell
52	carcinoma
53	.

1	We
2	show
3	,
4	by
5	injection
6	of
7	synthetic
8	mRNAs
9	,
10	that
11	the
12	cis
13	-
14	acting
15	sequences
16	responsible
17	for
18	repression
19	of

22	mRNA
23	reside
24	within
25	its
26	3
27	'
28	UTR
29	.

1	These
2	data
3	indicate
4	that
5	expansion
6	of
7	the
8	dodecamer
9	repeat
10	located
11	in
12	the
13	proximal
14	promoter
15	of
16	CSTB
17	severely
18	disrupts
19	the
20	function
21	of
22	the
23	promoter
24	and
25	thereby
26	reduces
27	transcription
28	of

30	.

1	Thus
2	,
3	while

3	The

9	significantly
10	when

1	The
